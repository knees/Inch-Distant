      <span>"Yeah it's alright." ~ Chief Journalism<br>
      <br>"I've read better, I've read worse." ~ Sub Morbid<br>
      <br>"It's a pretty standard retelling of our history." ~ Plant Freckle<br>
      <br>"I am sure to buy the next edition of The Death of Definitivity!" ~ Limit Ditch<br>
      <br>"You know what, that was pretty good!" ~ Anything Palmistry<br>
      <br>"I haven't read it yet, but I'm sure I'll get around to it." ~ Reticent Existence<br>
      <br>"Every now and then we come across a book so immaculate, so earth-shattering that all preconceived notions of the limits of literature are reconsidered. I'm not saying this is such a book, but it could be. I'll make that judgment if I decide to read this book one day." ~ Hastily Stimulant<br>
      <br>"Why the hell should I care about what that guy does? He's dead to me. Has been for a long time now. Ever since the incident. Cant forgive him." ~ Resterilizing Lore<br>
      <br>"Inch Distant does it again. His words have never been spelt so well and sentences so complete. I'd recommend this book to anyone who can read!" ~ Plunkers Coralligenous<br>
      <br>"A complete schism from the meta-modern literosphere, Inch Distant has filled the gap spanning the depth of human discovery and the moral opposition of determinism. Their words taught me more about my children than raising them alone ever did." ~ Puller So<br>
      <br>"Inch Distant is a disloyal, awful human being. Do not trust him with your money, do not allow him into your circle. He ruins all that he touches. The book is pretty alright though." ~ Sheath Cheese<br>
      <br>"There has never and will never be another writer quite like Inch Distant. Take that how you will." ~ Concrete Halloween<br>
      <br>"Where was I on the day that Inch Distant's rendition of tDoD was released? No clue. I didn't know who Inch was when his book dropped—no, no, sorry, yeah I know tDoD isn't his only book. Yeah ok, I'll call him to apologize later." ~ Countertime Lectureships<br>
      <br>"Inch's got some creativity, you can say that at the very least." ~ Cutover Biplanar<br>

      <br>"Amazing! Absolutely phenomenal! I told some girl that this was my new favorite book and it got me laid! I love lying!" -Jargon Disease<br>
      <br>"Again, I cannot express my warning any clearer: keep Inch Distant OUT of your life. He turned my whole family against me and nobody will even tell me why. He used his favor with the Four to put me on preventative parole. I'm fairly certain that he steals my thoughts without my permission as well." ~ Sheath Cheese<br>
      <br>"Hey, sorry I think you're meaning to reach someone else, you just asked me that and I said I haven't read it yet. Hope that clears things up. Bye bye." ~ Reticle Existence<br>
      <br>"This is the greatest book to have ever existed. It has changed my view on myself, my world, my perception of my world, my perception of my perception. The world needs to hear Inch's voice. They yearn for his word. Never before has our history been told with such passion." ~ Incarcerations Ambash<br>
      <br>"Inch Distant goes down like a chump with one swift blow to his jaw. Let that be known." ~ Glassy Cavalries<br>
      <br>"I watched Inch get clobbered once over a drunken argument, so I guess I kinda owe it to him to read his book. It's hard to read it though, with that mental image of him lying limp on the ground, quietly whimpering." ~ Arthritically Woodsy<br>
      <br>"The Death of Definitivity cured me of my impotence." ~ Leftovers Unhallowed<br>
      <br>"Inch Distant spoiled the ending of the first Alcorian age to me, knowing that I had yet to experience the event for myself. I hate this man. Again, this is no condemnation of his writing." ~ Sheath Cheese<br>
      <br>"They were not lying, this was his most Inch-Distantian work yet. It is certainly one of the books of all time." ~ Curvy Ceilinged<br>
      <br>"We have not seen such a dedicated attention to detail and historical accuracy in thousands of years!" ~ Dirt Hurter<br>
      <br>"This book saved my life." ~ Wombats Heterogeneous<br>
      <br>"I decided to start loving my kids after finishing this book." ~ Swamp Pants<br>
      <br>"Fuck you, Inch Distant." ~ Glib Shrimp<br>
      <br>"Now, in these exciting-times-as-ever, a dedication to serving the glory of our Quadrinity is needed within the populace, and Inch sure knows how to fill that role. Inch Distant is a model citizen. If everyone were as grateful as Inch, imagine what the Four could do for us?" ~ Curt Squirt<br>
      <br>"Hey what's the big idea? You already asked twice if I read the damn book. No. I still haven't read it. Maybe now I won't. Stop. Calling." ~ Reticle Existence<br>
      <br>"The plot, characters, and setting were my favorite part." ~ Lightning Disease<br>
      <br>"I don't see this being very franchisable." ~ Sad Seed<br>
      <br>"It's not as great as Inch's earlier works but it still held my attention. I have to say, though, I expected more from Inch Distant." ~ Frank Jangle<br>
      <br>"Inch Distant is a God amongst men. His words ring more true than any I've heard transported from the lips of the Four above. Inch is a champion of our history and deserves all of his praise!" ~ Demonic Toddler<br>
      <br>"Inchy baby! Shouts out to my boy Inchy!!" ~ Damp Pursuit<br>
      <br>"Seriously. I'm done. Take me off your list. Leave me alone. I will not be reading anything by Inch Distant. Goodbye." ~ Reticle Existence<br>
      <br>"Inch isn't the most pleasant person to be around, but if you need a seat filled or a warm body, he's there. And his books aren't half bad, too." ~ Polarized Embedding<br>
      <br>"Inch Distant owes me big time. Inch, if you're reading this, I'm coming for you." ~ Gold Smith<br>
      <br>"Gold Smith owes me big time as well. Inch, if you're reading this, please just give Goldie what he wants." ~ In Just<br>
      <br>"Oh my god, do you know Inch? Can you get me in touch with Inch? I have this idea I want to sh—" ~ Turtle Sandwich<br>
      <br>"I don't know if I could ever trust Inch again after the incident." ~ [REDACTED]<br>
      <br>"I know the chances are next to none, but every night, I pray my future child can be gifted with either Inch or Distant in their name. I want them to be an homage to the Pen of the Quadrinity." ~ Foot Near<br>
      <br>"Inch's writing is nearly as captivating as the plot of Alcorian Sudomirrum, and that is certainly saying something. You just can't beat the real thing!" ~ Grooms Electronic<br>
      <br>"The Tyrria Sudomirrum Investigative Force has insufficient evidence to form a conclusion around the disappearance of Mister Reticle Existence. We have no choice but to await action by the Four." ~ Dirt Rallying, Chief Inspector<br>
      <br>"What is this? Who are you? Where are we?" ~ Marc Barrows via AniUco Posthumous Interview<br>
      <br>"My favorite part was the end." ~ Trim Building<br>
      <br>"My favorite part was also the end." ~ Plump Speedily<br>
      <br>"Plump Speedily has not had a single original thought in her entire life." ~ Trim Building<br>
      <br>"Are you really doing this, right now?" ~ Plump Speedily<br>
      <br>"Go ahead, give an original tDoD take. I dare you." ~ Trim Building<br>
      <br>"Fine. Terrence and Abigail had it coming. They messed with forces they did not understand." ~ Plump Speedily<br>
      <br>"By the Four you better take that back right now. I'm serious. You always do this. You always go too far. If you didn't have me, you would push away everyone in your life." ~ Trim Building<br>
      <br>"We're done. I'm not taking this anymore. I've had enough of your shit." ~ Plump Speedily<br>
      <br>"Has anyone said that their favorite part was the end yet?" ~ Aurora Market<br>
      <br>"The Death of Definitivity speaks to your inner child, especially if you are reading it as a child." ~ Pocket Locker<br>
      <br>"It's crazy how terrible all other attempts to tell this story were before Inch Distant. We all owe him our lives." ~ Heavy Lard<br>
      <br>"I have receipts to show that I am the original author tDoD. Inch stole my magnum opus and changed 'Definity' to 'Definitivity.' This man is a fraud!" ~ Highway Opportunity<br>
      <br>"Look up 'Inch Distant Fraud Investigation.' It'll change your life." ~ Stand Mechanic<br>
      <br>"I have not seen my father in many, many years, but I will always support his writing. You did a great job on this one, Dad. Love you." ~ Treacherous Fragrance<br>
      <br>"I met Inch Distant in a ramen shop in the Limeer Su-Domirrum." ~ Joints Blunts<br>
      <br>"Inch once consulted me for the book for parts of Tupperware Interlude's Post-History. He didn't end up using any of it, but it was nice to talk to him." ~ Smack Smooch<br>
      <br>"The Death of Definitivity was pretty solid, but '12 Easy Steps to Win Over Friends and Lovers' remains as my favorite Inch Distant book." ~ Prim Sturgeon<br>
      <br>"Although these moments have been solidified in our history, Inch Distant still finds creative ways to present the narrative." ~ Shirt Pants<br>
      <br>"Inch Distant's thoroughness and attention to detail helped me discover my wife's infidelity. That very same detail is within these pages of which I adore much more than my spouse." ~ She Warts<br>
      <br>"I still have not been properly compensated for the rashes I got from the limited edition Inch Distant branded blanket." ~ Chortle Dove<br>
      <br>"This remains the only book that I have ever read. I promise to never read another." ~ Ready Introduction<br>

      <br>"I am very much looking forward to the release of 'The Birth of Quadrinity.'" ~ Orientation Fell<br>
